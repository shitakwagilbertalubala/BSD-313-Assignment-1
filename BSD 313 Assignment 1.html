      <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
      <p>Tim Berners Lee is a British computer scientist best known as the inventor of the World Wide Web. In 1989 while working at CERN in Switzerland, he proposed a system that would allow researchers to share and link documents across different computers. By 1990, he had created the first version of HTML, the first web browser, and the concept of URLs laying the foundation for the modern internet. His vision transformed global communication hence making information accessible to anyone with a connection. Today, Berners Lee is celebrated not only for his technical innovation but also for his commitment to keeping the web open and free for all.</p>

      <h2>ACHIEVEMENTS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Invention of the World Wide Web (1989–1990). This time he Proposed a system at CERN to link documents across different computers.
He developed HTML (HyperText Markup Language), HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) and URLs (Uniform Resource Locators).
He built the first web browser/editor called WorldWideWeb (later renamed Nexus).
<p>This invention transformed global communication, education and commerce.</p>
</li>
        <li>Advancing Open Standards.
He founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in 1994 to oversee web standards.
He advocated for interoperability and accessibility, ensuring the web remained free from corporate control.
He promoted semantic web technologies by aiming to make online data more meaningful and machine readable.
</li>
        <li>Leadership in Digital Rights.
He continued to campaign for net neutrality, privacy and universal access.
He founded the World Wide Web Foundation to promote digital equality.
He advocated for ethical use of data and transparency in online platforms.

      <h2>IMPACT ON ME</h2>
      <p>Tim Berners-Lee’s work has had a direct influence on how people like you and me live, learn and set career goals. His invention of the World Wide Web didn’t just change technology but also reshaped values around openness, accessibility and sharing knowledge.
For me, the impact shows up in three ways:
<p>1. Life: The web makes it possible to connect across borders, access information instantly, and participate in global conversations. Without his vision, everyday tasks like researching, communicating or even printing academic materials would be far more limited.</p>
<p>2. Values: Berners Lee’s insistence on keeping the web open and free inspires a commitment to transparency, inclusivity and fairness. It reinforces the idea that knowledge should be shared, not locked away.</p>
<p>3. Career Goals: His achievements highlight how one innovation can empower entire communities. It means you can use web-based tools to streamline academic transcription, mobilize communities and even create multilingual resources that reach wider audiences.
